## 🧠 Project Overview

This repository contains the complete implementation, simulation framework, training experiments, and results from my Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering Final Year Project:

> **Gait Control for a Quadruped Robot using Reinforcement Learning**

The objective of this project was to design, simulate, and evaluate stable and adaptive quadruped walking gaits using reinforcement learning algorithms. The system was built entirely in **MATLAB**, **Simulink**, and **Simscape Multibody**, using the **MATLAB Reinforcement Learning Toolbox**.

Three control strategies were developed and evaluated:
- **DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient)**
- **TD3 (Twin Delayed DDPG)**
- **Modified DDPG (mDDPG)**

The project focuses on stability, energy efficiency, and convergence performance in simulated locomotion.
